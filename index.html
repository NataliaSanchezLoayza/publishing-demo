          Bushwick’s Community Board has repeatedly raised concerns about the implementation of the NYC Permanent Open Restaurants Program. Bushwick neighbors located in Wilson Avenue seem to agree. Data shows that, during the program’s first year of operations, complaints about rodents and noise increased on this avenue. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          At the beginning of this month, twenty-nine of 51 community boards voted against an <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/plans/open-restaurants/open-restaurants-overview.page">amendment</a> that would remove geographic restrictions of where sidewalk cafes could be located within NYC. The review of the amendment by community board members and borough presidents was the first step in the implementation of the city’s Permanent Open Restaurants Program, an extension of the current program that was created due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Bushwick’s CB4 voted unanimously against it. 
        </p>

        <p>
          “The board members in attendance expressed significant concern about the absence of proposed design guidelines, the rushed nature of the process, and various quality of life issues directly resulting from the current open restaurant program”, read the letter Celestina Leon, District Manager of CB4, sent to the NYC Department of City Planning. In early September, during the meeting she’s mentioning, board members complained about different issues such as an increment in noise and rats, and loss of parking space. 

        </p>

        <p>
          In early October, during a City Planning Commission public meeting, Robert Camacho, chairman of CB4, reiterated his discontent with the program, saying, “We’re sick and tired of this Christopher Columbus syndrome, where they’re coming in here and throwing away natives. Please do not approve of this. Our land, they’re trying to take it away from us. All for money.” 
        </p>

        <p>
          As of today, according to the <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/ba953db7d541423a8e67ae1cf52bc698">map</a> of the current open restaurants, there are more than 12,000 of these establishments in the city, and 218 of them are in Bushwick. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Wilson is an avenue that crosses Bushwick right in the middle. Out of the 35 blocks in this avenue, only eleven of them allow sidewalk cafes according to the <a href="https://zola.planning.nyc.gov/about?layer-groups=%5B%22sidewalk-cafes%22%2C%22street-centerlines%22%5D#13/40.69666/-73.89983">current zoning</a>. Nevertheless, as of today, seventeen of Wilson Avenue’s blocks have sidewalk cafes on them, as part of the current program. 
        </p>

        <p>
          We analyzed the number of complaints Bushwick neighbors made to the 311 lines regarding rats and noise in Wilson Avenue from 2016 until 2021. In the case of the noise, we included 4 different types of it: Noise, Noise Residential, Noise Commercial, and Noise Street/Sidewalk. Since the Open Restaurants Program started in early June 2020, we compared these complaints starting June each year through May of the following year.

        Even though the complaints weren’t always increasing. The analysis proved that, until the end of June 2021, the biggest amount of complaints about both rodents and noise happened during the first year of the Open Restaurants Program, from June 2020 until May 2021.
      </p>

      <p>
        Apart from these, we found 55 other complaints related to the program. These are called Non-Compliance with Phased Reopening complaints.

        If the Permanent Open Restaurant Program gets approved, the zoning restrictions for sidewalk cafes will be lifted. Restaurants and bars would be able to apply for the program and, potentially, build their outdoor sitting spaces in residential avenues such as Wilson. The <a href="https://zap.planning.nyc.gov/projects/2021Y0291">next step</a> in the implementation of the Permanent Program is the City Council Review. There isn’t a date set for this.
